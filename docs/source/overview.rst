Overview of Features
====================

Cool-Seq-Tool provides easy access to, and useful operations on, a selection of important genomic resources. Modules are divided into three groups:

* :ref:`Data sources <data_sources_description>`, for basic acquisition and setup for a data source via Python

* :ref:`Data handlers <data_handlers_description>`, for additional operations on top of existing sources

* :ref:`Data mappers <data_mappers_description>`, for functions that incorporate multiple sources/handlers to produce output
